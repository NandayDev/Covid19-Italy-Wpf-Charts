# Covid19-Italy-Wpf-Charts
The Italian trend of the Covid19 infection, in a WPF .NET Core app. Data is fetched at every startup from the GitHub repository of the Italian "Protezione Civile" (Civil Protection?).

The application was written in an evening, and uses some .NET Framework libraries, but hopefully I'll fix that soon!
